                <p class="text-muted text-left">We believe that education is not just all about having a great classroom with amazing tutors and brilliant text books that can aide a child in scoring great results. But it is the personality in which they develop over the course of years through various interactive activities that helps in strengthening ones’ character.


Over here, we have a standard playground big enough to accommodate a cricket team or play kabbadi and volleyball. A library that houses plenty of books have been segregated and digitalised as well, accordingly to each section wise and curriculum. A well-equipped computer lab with trained faculties from NIIT is present to train and clear any doubts patiently. The high-tech auditorium here at RNS can house a capacity of 1000 and includes a world class projector, sound system and extensive lighting.


There is also a fully fledged transport system with 6 buses that comes with skilled and experienced drivers and tolerant helpers to help toddlers get in and get out the bus as well as help them get across the street safely. Furthermore, we give training to all the pupils enrolled at RNS in yoga, karate, handwriting, Vedic maths and drawing. It is important to us in that we see the child grow and evolve in all aspects in life.


With the state of the art classrooms, well edited text books from highly versed reknown authors and play grounds and libraries that is bound to help in the growth of a child, both in personality and in physicality, we make sure that each student enrolled here with us gets the equal exposure to cope up with any hardships they might need to face with the outside world.


Admissions are open to all students alike during the general month of the admission process.

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive.

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Copenhagen, Mar 5 (IANS): As Covid-19 transmission rates once again begin to rise across the European region, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge urged the region to return to basics when dealing with the pandemic.

As new cases of Covid-19 in Europe rose nine per cent to just above one million, it brought to an end a six-week decline in new cases and the stark realization that variants were making significant headway in the region, Kluge said during a virtual press conference here on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported."We are seeing a resurgence in central and Eastern Europe. New cases are also on the rise in several western European countries where rates were already high."

However, the WHO official declined to offer the support to the creation of "corona passports" many countries in the EU have been mulling over.

"WHO does not recommend passports, but I also believe that as we see already, somehow, it may be unavoidable," said Kluge.

While acknowledging the "feasibility, and the desirability" of corona passports, Kluge told Xinhua that the "passports" came with "some caveats."

"From a scientific point of view, how long does a vaccine give immunity? It is not so clear yet. And if you get a vaccine, it protects you but does not necessarily stop transmission. So it's not a watertight thing."

According to Kluge, the overarching concern for the WHO was rather an intelligent access to vaccines that would help to reduce vaccine inequality.

"What WHO is taking forward is a smart vaccination consumption. It is on the digital certification because it is important that whoever is vaccinated, there is a document there."

Kluge further reiterated that the WHO followed the international health regulations when it came to travel and trade and saw discussions on the issue of a passport as ongoing.

"The passport itself is not recommended by WHO. The certificate, of course, yes. And a number of very important considerations, which need to be taken into account."

Meanwhile, the WHO Regional Director called for the need to return to "basics" using tools such as increased vigilance, improved testing, focus on prevention, re-engagement with communities, evidence-driven re-openings and an accelerated roll-out of vaccines if the region was to again drive back the coronavirus and its variants.</p>

In this beloved revised classic, beginning readers and budding astronomers are launched on a wild trip to visit the eight planets in our solar system (per the International Astronomical Union’s 2006 decision to downgrade Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet), along with the Cat in the Hat, Thing One, Thing Two, Dick, and Sally. It’s a reading adventure that’s out of this world!<br>
